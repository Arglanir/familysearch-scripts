# familysearch-scripts
Scripts useful when working with [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/)

## Usage
Open FamilySearch, log in, then navigate to the page of one person, like yourself (or an ancestor for [family-lines-down.js](family-lines-down.js))

In a javascript console, copy/paste the content of [recursive-search.js](recursive-search.js), then you can copy/paste one of the following scripts:

### From yourself:
* [family-names-cloud.js](family-names-cloud.js): allows you to create a name cloud of the family names.
* [family-depth.js](family-depth.js): allows you to find the ending lines in your genealogy.

### From an ancestor:
* [family-lines-down.js](family-lines-down.js): allows you to find lines descending from an ancestor.
